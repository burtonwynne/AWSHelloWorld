Bloomberg today announced 
the appointment of Michelle L. Goldstein as Executive Director of the Office of 
Federal Affairs - New York City's Washington, DC Office. Goldstein has led New 
York City's Albany office since 2006, spearheading the City's successful efforts 
to pass major pieces of state legislation, including bills that reauthorized 
mayoral control of the public school system, reformed the antiquated Wicks law, 
cut taxes for many small businesses, and advanced the Administration's ambitious 
environmental agenda.&amp;nbsp; Michelle also led the negotiations that resulted in 
the State take-over of the NYC Off-Track Betting Corporation. Her new 
appointment will take effect on February 16.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Michelle has been one of the unsung stars 
of our Administration," said Mayor Bloomberg.&amp;nbsp; "Thanks to her leadership 
and tireless work ethic, we have accomplished an extraordinary amount in Albany: 
maintaining mayoral control of schools, reducing construction costs for city 
taxpayers, taking truck traffic off our neighborhood streets, reducing taxes for 
17,000 freelancers and small businesses - and the list could go on and on.&amp;nbsp; 
At a time when Washington's actions - and inactions - are having increasingly 
profound effects on our City, I have the utmost confidence in Michelle's ability 
to work with our Congressional delegation, and all members of Congress and the 
Obama Administration, to deliver for New Yorkers."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"I am proud of what we have accomplished 
over the past several years, and I am eager to build on the successes of the 
Washington office as we face continued challenges presented by national 
legislative and funding issues," said Executive Director Goldstein. "This is a 
critical time for New York City on a number of fronts, and I am looking forward 
to continuing to work with Mayor Bloomberg, his Administration and the myriad 
stakeholders in Washington to help make New York City even greater."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Michelle has been an invaluable 
member of our team, and is poised to excel in this new appointment," said Deputy 
Mayor for Government Relations Kevin Sheekey. "Her successes in Albany have 
touched the lives of every New Yorker, and I couldn't be more confident about 
how she will help us carry out the Mayor's ambitious agenda in the third term 
from Washington."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Office of Federal Affairs, established 
by Mayor John Lindsay, is charged with ensuring New Yorkers get their fair share 
of federal dollars and that policies made on Capitol Hill and in the White House 
address the needs of the nation's largest city. Goldstein will play a central 
role in the work to shape the national policies Mayor Bloomberg has targeted as 
priorities, including the campaign against illegal guns, the support of 
long-term infrastructure investments, and the new efforts to promote sensible 
immigration reform, which Mayor Bloomberg announced last week in his Inaugural 
Address.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Goldstein has served in the Bloomberg 
Administration as Director of State Legislative Affairs since July 2006.&amp;nbsp; 
Under her leadership, the City achieved a series of major legislative victories, 
including the re-authorization of mayoral control of schools, an infrastructure 
agreement to allow a key component of the City's landmark Solid Waste Management 
Plan to move forward, tax abatements for green roofs and solar panels, and a new 
law giving social workers the information and tools they need to prevent child 
abuse.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 2008, Goldstein led the City's 
negotiations that resulted in the State take-over of the NYC Off-Track Betting 
Corporation, ending the longstanding, fiscally-flawed arrangement between the 
City and OTB. In 2009, she helped make the case in Albany for reauthorization of 
mayoral control of schools. The bill that was signed into law preserves a system 
of clear accountability for New York City schools that has produced clear and 
dramatic results for students.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Goldstein has also advised the Mayor on 
State budget issues and has worked aggressively to ensure that the City is 
treated fairly by Albany, including negotiating a restoration of the City's 
revenue sharing and settlement of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity lawsuit.&amp;nbsp; 
In addition, she helped secure passage of various mandate relief items that the 
City had been working on for years, including significant reform of the Wicks 
Law, which requires multiple contracts on single projects and dates back to 
1961.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Goldstein successfully negotiated various 
tax policy changes, including the transformation of the Industrial and 
Commercial Incentive Program from an inefficient drain on the City's budget to a 
program that creates significant new economic activity at the lowest possible 
cost.&amp;nbsp; She also oversaw passage of a bill that modernizes New York City's 
tax laws and includes the reduction or elimination of the Unincorporated 
Business Tax and a phase-in of the "single-sales factor" which will encourage 
businesses to locate in New York City.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Before joining the Bloomberg Administration, 
Goldstein served as Director of Government Affairs for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. Prior to that, she held a variety of government 
relations positions within City government: Director of Local Government 
Relations for the Department of Education, Director of the Mayor's Office of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Assistant Director of Intergovernmental Relations for 
the Office of Management and Budget and Deputy Director of the Office of State 
Legislative Affairs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Executive Director Goldstein holds a 
Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan and a Master of Public 
Administration from the Baruch College School of Public Affairs. Born and raised 
in New York City, Goldstein graduated from Susan Wagner High School in Staten 
Island and currently lives in Manhattan.&lt;/P&gt;
