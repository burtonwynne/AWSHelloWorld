Bloomberg On Stanford University Study of Customer Purchases at Starbucks Following New York City's Calorie Posting Regulation</brief_pr_title><paragraph>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Independent Study Showing Calories in Items Purchased Went Down - But Stores' Revenue Did Not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;#8220;Researchers at 
Stanford have analyzed 100 million Starbucks customer receipts, and the results 
should please anyone who cares about health. The researchers found that the 
number of calories in an average Starbucks purchase is down by 6% since New York 
City adopted its groundbreaking calorie-posting rule, and people who typically 
purchase more than 250 calories cut the calories in what they bought by even 
more &amp;#8211; 26%. While calorie consumption declined in response to calorie posting, 
Starbucks revenues did not. This study helps confirm what we&amp;#8217;ve believed all 
along &amp;#8211; consumers can make healthier choices when supplied with the right 
information, and businesses can profit while offering their customers healthier 
alternatives. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; 
&amp;#8220;By requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus and menu 
boards, New York City has sparked a national response 
to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. We gave New Yorkers the ability to 
choose foods with fewer calories, and now consumers are using that information 
and benefiting from it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
