Visas and Launching Plans Highlights Need for Comprehensive Immigration 
Reform&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg today announced 
that the entrepreneur team from the Indian Institute of Technology 
Madras has been selected as the winner of NYC 
Next Idea 2009-2010, an inaugural global business plan competition launched by 
New York City 
last year. The team, Greenext Technology Solutions, devised a new system to 
allow utility companies and energy producers to store and distribute energy 
through remote sites across the five boroughs safely and efficiently, and was 
selected by a panel of judges from New 
York City&amp;#8217;s venture capital community to receive a 
$20,000 cash prize. The NYC Next Idea competition was announced in February 2009 
as part of a suite of initiatives dedicated to strengthening New York City&amp;#8217;s 
entrepreneurial community. The competition was launched to raise the visibility 
of the City as an international center for innovation and entrepreneurship and 
showcase the talent from business and engineering schools around the world, 
while also encouraging innovative business ventures that can launch and operate 
here. The Mayor was joined at the announcement at Columbia Business School, which helped administer the 
competition, by Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Robert C. Lieber, New York 
City Economic Development Corporation President Seth W. Pinsky, Mayor&amp;#8217;s Office 
of Immigrant Affairs Commissioner Fatima Shama, Columbia University Senior 
Executive Vice President Robert Kasdin, Laura Resnikoff, director of the 
Columbia Business School Private Equity Program and the three finalist teams 
from India, Spain and France.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=default&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;&amp;#8220;Cities 
around the world hope to be a place of innovation where entrepreneurs want to go 
to launch businesses,&amp;#8221; said Mayor Bloomberg. &amp;#8220;New York City doesn&amp;#8217;t have to hope &amp;#8211; we are 
that place. Just look at the talented teams from the world&amp;#8217;s leading business 
and engineering schools that participated in our NYC Next Idea inaugural global 
business plan competition. But it&amp;#8217;s not enough to be a place entrepreneurs want 
to go; we also have to make sure our city &amp;#8211; and our country &amp;#8211; is a place they 
can go. That&amp;#8217;s why we are committed to working with the Obama Administration to 
pursue sensible immigration reform. No one can say for sure whether the 
finalists&amp;#8217; ideas will translate into successful job-creating businesses. What a 
shame, though, if they and countless others are denied the opportunity even to 
try.&amp;#8221;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=default&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Fifteen leading business 
and engineering universities from countries across Asia, Latin America, and 
Europe signed up to participate in NYC Next Idea 2009-2010, and ten teams 
submitted final proposals. The three teams of finalists representing business 
and engineering schools in France, Spain, and India were in New York City this week to present their plans. 
Business plans targeted sectors such as Financial Services, Media &amp;amp; 
Technology, Green Technology and Bioscience, and included a new screening 
product for infectious diseases, a zero-emission bike-share program, and new 
telecom technology. In addition to the cash prize, the winning team will be 
offered free space within one of the City&amp;#8217;s new business incubators for two 
years&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;#8220;To continue to grow and innovate 
New York City 
must continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the globe,&amp;#8221; said 
Deputy Mayor Lieber. &amp;#8220;NYC Next Idea helps us expand New York City&amp;#8217;s standing as 
a global center for innovation and entrepreneurship and bring leading business 
students to launch their firms here. By making it easier to get a business off 
the ground, and setting the stage for growth across a variety of sectors 
New York City 
will be better poised to capture growth and create jobs moving 
forward.&amp;#8221;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;#8220;A key to maintaining New York&amp;#8217;s status as the 
world&amp;#8217;s economic capital is ensuring that we continue to attract and retain 
talented entrepreneurs from around the globe,&amp;#8221; said New York City Economic 
Development Corporation President Pinsky. &amp;#8220;To this end, we recently launched our 
new NYC Next Idea competition &amp;#8211; a competition designed to bring the business 
leaders of tomorrow to the City, today. We are thrilled that this competition 
has been such a success in its inaugural year and are proud to add it to our 
growing list of offerings aimed at the entrepreneurial community, including 
programs providing access to much-needed start-up financing and inexpensive 
space, as well as training and networking opportunities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=default&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;The 
competition, administered by the New York City Economic Development Corporation 
and supported by Columbia Business School, was open to new, independent ventures 
in the conceptual, seed, start-up, or early growth stages, and business concepts 
that included the expansion of an existing venture into New York City. Criteria 
for judging the applications included commercial viability of the product or 
service; market analysis and a need for the product or service in New York City; 
comprehensiveness of the company&amp;#8217;s sales and marketing plan; the company&amp;#8217;s 
competitive differentiation over other players in the market; caliber of team 
members and advisors; financial analysis; and coherency of the final 
presentation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;#8220;This competition is about discovering the 
next generation of business innovators in New York 
City, and we&amp;#8217;re grateful that the city&amp;#8217;s development leaders have 
turned to Columbia for support in that endeavor,&amp;#8221; said 
Laura Resnikoff, director of the Columbia Business School Private Equity Program 
and adviser to the New York City Economic Development Corporation&amp;#8217;s competition 
team.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=default&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; 
 The other finalists were Biofont from INSEAD Business School in Fontainebleau, France, and NYCycling from 
IESE Business School of the University of Navarra, Spain. The teams were judged 
in the final round by FirstMark Capital CEO and Managing Director Lawrence 
Lenihan, RRE Ventures General Partner Will D. Porteous, Greycroft LLC Partner 
Andrew B. Lipsher, Ascent Biomedical Ventures Partner Arthur Tinkelenberg, 
Ph.D, and NYCEDC Executive Vice 
President Steven Strauss, Ph.D. Columbia Business School alumni including W 
Capital Partners Vice President Eugene Song, Latin America Venture Capital 
Association Director of Strategy and Product Development Ariel Muslera, and 
Greenhill Capital Partners Vice President Somak Chattopadhyay judged the second round. 
NYCEDC&amp;nbsp; released a Request for Proposals today to solicit a university 
partner for NYC Next Idea 2010-2011. Information on the RFP will be available at

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the last year alone, the City has 
announced more 50 initiatives to address a wide range of obstacles faced by the 
small- and medium-size businesses throughout the five boroughs who are creating 
the building blocks of our new economy. These range from lowering taxes, to 
increasing capital availability, to starting training and networking programs, 
to providing opportunities to secure thousands of discounted work stations 
across the five boroughs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=default&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Below 
are summaries of the finalist plans provided by the three 
teams:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;BIOFONT&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;University: INSEAD: Institut Europ&amp;#233;en d'Administration

  Bisht &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With pandemic outbreaks 
of infections increasing in frequency, there is a clear need for screening tools 
to detect individuals with infectious diseases, especially in densely populated 
and highly interconnected urban areas such as New York City.&amp;nbsp;BioFont is a biotechnology 
proposal that has developed a ground-breaking product that can be used to screen 
individuals for infectious diseases in an expeditious and accurate manner. 
Though methods exist to screen large numbers of people for potentially 
contagious illnesses, none are affordable, quick, or easily used without 
detailed training. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BioFont is taking 
advantage of the latest breakthroughs in biotechnology, and the major paradigm 
shift in the healthcare sector away from laboratory table-top blood analyzers to 
develop a product that is affordable, simple to use, and provides accurate and 
quick results. The product is a combination of a portable electronic analyzer 
and disposable test strips, which process and display results in a simple yes/no 
format. Beyond the healthcare sector, BioFont envisages a demand for this 
product in New York 
City&amp;#8217;s schools, airports, public places, households, and 
workplaces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;NYCYCLING&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;University: &lt;SPAN lang=EN&gt;IESE: Instituto 
  de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa (Institute of Higher 
  Business Studies) &lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;#8211; SPAIN 
  &lt;LI&gt;Team members: Patricia Bayley, Adrian Lui 
  and Martin Mazza&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;NYCycling is an 
innovative zero-emission bike-share program designed to transport users from one 
destination to the next within New York 
City. This new, clean and healthy transportation 
alternative is composed of a system of self-service stations at which users can 
rent bicycles, ride them to their destination, and return them to the nearest 
station. The program offers a creative solution that alleviates transportation 
bottlenecks and utilizes the existing infrastructure in New York City&amp;#8217;s current 
transportation system &amp;#8211; over 600 miles of bike paths traversing the 
metropolis.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Learning from 
established bike-share programs, NYCycling aims to offer a high service level 
for a responsible price to cyclists in New York City.&amp;nbsp; Through partnerships with 
corporations, non-profits, and law enforcements, NYCycling also aims to become a 
successful and publicly appreciated alternative form of local transportation. 
&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;GREENEXT 
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;University: IIT: Indian Institute of Technology Madras 
  &amp;#8211; INDIA 
  &lt;LI&gt;Team members: Aashish Dattani, Sriram 
  Kalyanaraman and Vinayshankar Kulkarni&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Greenext Technology 
Solutions is clean-technology proposal that is pioneering specialized software 
and hardware solutions to utility companies, renewable energy producers, energy 
storage manufacturers, and energy traders. Their product, XEstor, serves as a 
common interface to store energy from any source across New York 
City&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;into large battery 
storage sites. The product communicates with the electric grid and combines 
real-time consumer demand information with current energy prices to charge or 
discharge electricity into the grid. This flexible mechanism to produce or store 
energy based on demand can act as a backup power source to bridge supply gaps 
and maintain the grid&amp;#8217;s reliability through ancillary services such as 
regulation and emergency response.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Greenext Technology 
Solutions team strongly believes that today&amp;#8217;s challenges in the energy sector 
can be addressed through clean-technology solutions such as smart grids that 
hold the potential to meet growing energy demands. Greenext Technology Solutions 
team is convinced that with energy demand continuing to rise rapidly on the one 
hand and both energy availability and supply efficiency struggling to meet it on 
the other, financial incentives and deregulation of electricity markets will 
make their solution a highly viable one in the future.&amp;nbsp; And New York City is a prime 
locale for such technology because of its burgeoning population and energy 
needs, as well as an electric grid in need of innovative 
upgrades.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
