Bloomberg, Deputy Mayor for Economic 
Development Robert C. Lieber and NYC &amp;amp; Company CEO George Fertitta today 
announced in 2009 New York City was the most popular tourist destination in the 
United States for the first time since 1990. The 45.25 million tourists exceeded 
projections, declining just 3.9 percent from 2008 versus the 10 percent 
expected. A 3.2 percent increase in tourism, with an estimated 46.7 million 
visitors, is expected in 2010. Mayor Bloomberg also announced that employment in 
the leisure and hospitality sector has fully rebounded and surpassed 
pre-recession levels. New York City remains the most popular destination in the 
nation for international visitors with 8.6 million international tourists in 
2009 - twice as many as the nearest competitor, Los Angeles. The Mayor made the 
announcement at the Greenhouse Cafe in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he was joined 
by New York Hotel &amp;amp; Motel Trades Council President Peter Ward, and Bobby 
Daquara and John Keegan, co-owners of the Greenhouse Caf&amp;#233; in Bay Ridge, 
Brooklyn, a participating restaurant in NYC &amp;amp; Company's upcoming "Restaurant 
Week" promotion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Over the past eight years, our efforts to make New York 
City an even more exciting place to visit have helped produce a record number of 
tourists and create thousands of jobs," said Mayor Bloomberg. "Last year, while 
tourism declined significantly in cities across the country, we fared far better 
than most. In fact, for the first time in 20 years, we were the most popular 
tourism destination in the country, surpassing Orlando, and our leisure and 
hospitality jobs rose - surpassing even their pre-recession levels. Despite 
these gains, we know many of our hotels, restaurants, attractions and shops are 
still struggling as a result of the downturn, but the jobs they have added serve 
as an important indication that our efforts are paying off and that 2010 
promises to be a year of growth."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"We began 2009 facing a dismal forecast for the city's 
tourism industry," said George Fertitta, CEO of NYC &amp;amp; Company, the official 
marketing, tourism and partnership organization for the City of New York. "Our 
initial projections estimated a ten percent decrease, but we continued to invest 
and strategically promote New York City to domestic and international visitors 
as well as to New Yorkers. As a result, New York City saw a less than four 
percent decline in visitation, and still holds onto an ambitious goal of 
attracting 50 million visitors annually by 2012.&amp;nbsp; We expect that 2010 will 
be a year of recovery, and we will continue to find new ways to promote the City 
to all travelers."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Every day, hotel and restaurant workers see the benefits 
of the Bloomberg Administration and NYC and Company's innovative and aggressive 
strategies to promote tourism," said New York Hotel &amp;amp; Motel Trades Council 
President Peter Ward. "When New York's hospitality industry thrives, the jobs it 
creates are some of the best family-sustaining service sector jobs in the city. 
In a time of declining wages and rising unemployment, the tourism sector remains 
a way for tens of thousands of working people to provide a good quality of life 
for their families and opportunity for their children. Our members live in every 
borough of the city and truly serve as ambassadors to our city's millions of 
visitors each year. We are the first people to greet our visitors upon their 
arrival, we help them navigate the city, serve their meals, maintain their 
rooms, and make sure their stays are as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. 
New York's hotel workers provide a world-class level of service, and constantly 
work to ensure that our city remains one of the country's and the world's 
favorite places to visit."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;New York City surpassed Orlando in total visitors in 2009 
after finishing second in 2008. The City remains on track to achieve its goal of 
50 million annual visitors by 2012 despite the effects of the global recession. 
The more than 45 million people who visited New York City last year spent 
approximately $28 billion. Every dollar of direct tourist spending translates 
into a total of $1.50 in economic activity for New York. New York City welcomed 
an estimated 36.7 million domestic visitors and 8.6 international visitors to 
the City in 2009. International tourists remain particularly important to the 
City's economy because they spend nearly five times as much as their domestic 
counterparts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Approximately 311,000 people are currently employed in 
the leisure and hospitality industry in New York City - surpassing the 307,000 
employed in late 2007 and marking the highest November employment level on 
record. The gains in employment touched all areas of the sector with employment 
at food service/restaurants and bars growing by 1.1 percent and employment in 
hotels growing by 2.6 percent compared to 2008.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hotel demand remained very strong, with 23.6 million room 
nights sold - a new City record and 300,000 more than the previous year. Hotel 
occupancy rates during the final three months of 2009 were higher than they were 
during the same period in 2008 - generating roughly $315 million in hotel tax 
revenue for the year.&amp;nbsp; More than 5,100 new and renovated rooms were added 
in 2009, bringing the city's total inventory to more than 81,500 hotel rooms, an 
increase of 6 percent.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;International airport arrivals, while down for the year, 
showed two consecutive months of increases in September and October, after 10 
months of decreases. Non-commuter Amtrak arrivals showed positive growth in 
October for the first time since September, 2008, with 328,700 passengers during 
the month, November saw another increase over the previous year with 332,100 
passengers. Season-to-date through November, Broadway revenues rose by $3 
million in 2009, 0.6 percent increase.&lt;/P&gt;

in 2010, NYC &amp;amp; Company today kicked off its NYC: The Real Deal Winter
