This is Mayor Mike Bloomberg.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"While the past year was a tough one for many New 
Yorkers, there are lots of reasons to expect a better 2010. Our schools are 
improving. Our quality of life is unsurpassed. The City's economy is poised for 
recovery from the national recession. And one of the biggest reasons for that is 
the NYPD's remarkable continued success in making the nation's safest big city 
safer still - even at a time of economic distress.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"The numbers speak for themselves. During 2009, there 
were fewer murders in New York City than at any time since 1963.&amp;nbsp; It was 
our second year in three with fewer than 500 homicides, and the eighth straight 
year with fewer than 600; compare that to the not-so-distant past, when murders 
sometimes hit close to 2,000 a year. Since 2001, we've cut murders by 29 
percent, rapes by 38 percent, robberies by 34 percent, auto theft by 64 percent. 
In fact, all categories of the most serious felonies in our city by nearly 35 
percent combined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"What's more, we've also dramatically increased safety 
in what were once problem areas.&amp;nbsp; Over the past eight years, for example, 
we've reduced crime in our transit system by nearly half, and at the city's 
public housing developments by nearly a third. And since 2003, Operation Impact 
- which floods troubled, targeted areas with teams of rookie and veteran 
officers - has sharply cut crime in these impact zones.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Our City's Finest deserve enormous credit for all these 
achievements. And we've done everything we can to aid their efforts - especially 
with our intense focus on ridding our city of illegal guns. No question about 
it, the tough new laws we've helped enact, our stepped-up enforcement, and our 
undercover investigations of illegal out-of-state gun sales have combined to 
help make our streets safer than ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Even as it continues to lead the nation in reducing 
street crime, the NYPD also remains at the forefront in preventing terrorism. 
The more than 1,000 of our top officers who work in intelligence and 
counter-terrorism have come through for us, time and again. And to strengthen 
our counter-terrorism efforts, during 2010 we'll start extending the 
state-of-the-art network of sensors, license plate readers, and closed-circuit 
cameras now protecting Lower Manhattan to a large swath of Midtown as 
well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Now, how much further can we reduce crime?&amp;nbsp; We aim 
to find out. Last Friday, when I took the oath of office for another term as 
mayor, I said that in the years ahead, we'd redouble our efforts to fight crime 
by preventing it where it's still most troubling: Among young people who are 
disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of crime. We're going to do 
even more to protect their lives and futures, and also to ensure the future and 
safety of the city we love.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"This is Mayor Mike Bloomberg.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for 
listening."&lt;/P&gt;
