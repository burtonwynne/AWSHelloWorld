MFTA Orders WebService
======================
I kind of tackled this task a little out of order.  I created the database 
schema but never ran it against the CCRB database.  I just got the CCRB 
credentials today. I instead created the a local mysql database and pointed the
app at the table that I created. You'll have to created the tables yourself, 
either that or I believe JPA/Hibernate will create the tables for you.  I also
included a translation of the sql to dialect but it was auto generated.

I created four entities: Customer, Item, Order and OrderItem.  Customer holds 
basic customer information.  Item contains metadata about items.  Orders contains
metadata about the order.  Finally there is OrderItems which is more of a relational
connecting Orders to Items: its only relevant information is the quantity of items in
order.  This is more of a hack since its really a relationship table but that was the 
only way I could express that relationship. If you can find a better way to express 
this relationship...  Also you might want to take a look at the table MFTA_MEMBER.

There a repository for each of the four entities.
